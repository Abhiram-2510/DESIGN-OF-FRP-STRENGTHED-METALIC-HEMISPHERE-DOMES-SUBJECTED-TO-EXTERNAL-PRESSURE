# DESIGN-OF-FRP-STRENGTHED-METALIC-HEMISPHERE-DOMES-SUBJECTED-TO-EXTERNAL-PRESSURE
Thin metallic cylindrical shell structures wrapped externally with one or multiple
layers of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite sheets exhibit a significant
increase in buckling capacity and ductility. The existing research is minimal, limited
to shells of specific radius-to-thickness ratios, and often reported only the buckling
capacity and ductility percentage increase. This research is intended to bridge this
gap and provide a comprehensive understanding of the buckling behavior of metalFRP hybrid shell structures. It focusses on 1) detailed numerical modeling
addressing different aspects as well as non-linarites viz. intra-laminar and interfacial
damage specific to metal-FRP hybrid shells, 2) effectiveness of FRP strengthening
and effective FRP strengthening methods for metallic shells of all possible ratios, 3)
imperfection sensitivity of hybrid shells of different rratios, 4) the effect of cut-outs in
thin airframe hybrid shells of higher ratios, and 5) experimental validation of
buckling characteristics of both the metallic and metal-FRP hybrid airframe plain
cylindrical shells. Thus, the thesis brings out the following aspects of metal-FRP
hybrid shells: 1) the effect of interfacial and intraluminal FRP damage on buckling
behavior, 2) the effectiveness of FRP strengthening on the general buckling behavior
of shells of different ratios, 3) the sensitivity to imperfections, 4) the effect of
unstiffened and stiffened cut-outs on elastically buckling shells, and 5) the methods
to assess bond quality, measurement of imperfections and experimental validation.
